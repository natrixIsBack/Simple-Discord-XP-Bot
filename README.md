# Simple-Discord-XP-Bot
A simple yet effective Discord bot built with the latest versions of discord.js (v14) and Node.js. This bot implements an XP and leveling system, rewarding users with experience points (XP) for each message they send. Upon reaching certain XP thresholds, users level up, and the bot notifies them of their new level.
